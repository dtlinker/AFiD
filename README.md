# Atrial Fibrillation Screening App
This is a progressive web-app (PWA) that is designed for individual screening for atrial fibrillation by collecting and analyzing pulse data from finger using the camera of a smartphone.

The intent of this project is to create free tool that can be distributed by health care systems to patients with smartphones. 

Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm that can be asymptomatic, but can increase the risk of stroke. This app could help screen patients to detect asymptomatic atrial fibrillation, allowing treatment to reduce the risk of stroke.

The concept and overall architecture for the app was developed by David T. Linker, M.D. The implementation was developed as a Bioengineering Capstone Project in 2021 by Charlie Bohlin, Matthew Halim and Jeremy Aguirre. 

The atrial fibrillation algorithm is based on algorithms developed by Dr. Linker, ajnd previously covered under US and international patents, which have intentionally been allowed to expire. For a list of the patents, see the the file ALGORITHM.md.
